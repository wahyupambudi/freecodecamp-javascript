Access Array Data with Indexes

We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.

Example

const array = [50, 60, 70];
console.log(array[0]);
const data = array[1];

The console.log(array[0]) prints 50, and data has the value 60.

Create a variable called myData and set it to equal the first value of myArray using bracket notation.

Tests

Passed: The variable myData should equal the first value of myArray.
Passed: The data in variable myArray should be accessed using bracket notation.

//code
const myArray = [50, 60, 70];
const myData = myArray[0];
console.log(myData);
