Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript

We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

Example

const myVar = 16 / 2;

myVar now has the value 8.

Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.

Passed: The variable quotient should be equal to 2.
Passed: You should use the / operator.

const quotient = 66 / 33;
