Understand String Immutability

In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

For example, the following code will produce an error because the letter B in the string Bob cannot be changed to the letter J:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";

Note that this does not mean that myStr could not be re-assigned. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new value, like this:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";

Correct the assignment to myStr so it contains the string value of Hello World using the approach shown in the example above.


Tests

Passed: myStr should have a value of the string Hello World.
Passed: You should not change the code above the specified comment.


// Setup
let myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line
// myStr[0] = "H"; // Change this line
myStr = "Hello World"; // Change this line

// Only change code above this line
console.log(myStr)
