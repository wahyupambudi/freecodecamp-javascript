Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function

A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

Example

let sum = 0;

function addSum(num) {
  sum = sum + num;
}

addSum(3);

addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.

Create a function addFive without any arguments. This function adds 5 to the sum variable, but its returned value is undefined.

Tests

Passed: addFive should be a function.
Passed: Once both functions have run, the sum should be equal to 8.
Passed: Returned value from addFive should be undefined.
Passed: Inside the addFive function, you should add 5 to the sum variable.


// Setup
let sum = 0;

function addThree() {
  return sum = sum + 3;
}

// Only change code below this line
function addFive() {
  sum += 5;
}

// Only change code above this line

console.log(addThree());
console.log(addFive());
