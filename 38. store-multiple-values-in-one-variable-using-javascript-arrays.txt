Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];

Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).

Tests

Passed: myArray should be an array.
Passed: The first item in myArray should be a string.
Passed: The second item in myArray should be a number.

// Only change code below this line
const myArray = ["Wahyu pambudi", 2024, "Web Developer"];
