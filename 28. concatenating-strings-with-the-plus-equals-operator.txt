Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator

We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

let ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

ourStr now has a value of the string I come first. I come second..

Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: This is the first sentence. and This is the second sentence. using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown in the example and be sure to include a space between the two strings. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string.

Tests

Passed: myStr should have a single space character between the two strings.
Passed: myStr should have a value of the string This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.
Passed: You should use the += operator to build myStr


let myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence."
