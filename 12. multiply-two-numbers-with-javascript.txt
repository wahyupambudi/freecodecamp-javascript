Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript

We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example

const myVar = 13 * 13;

myVar would have the value 169.

Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.

Passed: The variable product should be equal to 80.
Passed: You should use the * operator.

const product = 8 * 10;
