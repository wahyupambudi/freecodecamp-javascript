Nest one Array within Another Array

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];

This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

Create a nested array called myArray.

Tests

Passed: myArray should have at least one array nested within another array.

// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [
  ["Wahyu Pambudi", 2024], ["Web Developer", "2 Digit"]
];
