Global Scope and Functions

In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with let or const.

Using let or const, declare a global variable named myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it with a value of 10.

Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the var, let or const keywords.

Tests

Passed: myGlobal should be defined
Passed: myGlobal should have a value of 10
Passed: myGlobal should be declared using the let or const keywords
Passed: oopsGlobal should be a global variable and have a value of 5


// Declare the myGlobal variable below this line
let myGlobal = 10;
// let oopsGlobal;

function fun1() {
  // Assign 5 to oopsGlobal here
  oopsGlobal = 5;
}

// Only change code above this line
function fun2() {
  let output = "";
  if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
  }
  if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
  }
  console.log(output);
}
