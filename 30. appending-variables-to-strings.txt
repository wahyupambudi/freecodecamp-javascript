Appending Variables to Strings

Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

Example:

const anAdjective = "awesome!";
let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

ourStr would have the value freeCodeCamp is awesome!.

Set someAdjective to a string of at least 3 characters and append it to myStr using the += operator.


Tests

Passed: someAdjective should be set to a string at least 3 characters long.
Passed: You should append someAdjective to myStr using the += operator.


// Change code below this line
const someAdjective = "Make me awikawokawikawok";
let myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;

console.log(myStr)
