Declare String Variables

Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:

var myName;

But you can also declare a string variable like this:

var myName = "your name";

"your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

Passed: myFirstName should be a string with at least one character in it.
Passed: myLastName should be a string with at least one character in it.


// craete two variable with value string
var myFirstName = "Wahyu";
var myLastName = "Pambudi";
