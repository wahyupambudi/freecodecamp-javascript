Find the Length of a String

You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

console.log("Alan Peter".length);

The value 10 would be displayed in the console. Note that the space character between "Alan" and "Peter" is also counted.

For example, if we created a variable const firstName = "Ada", we could find out how long the string Ada is by using the firstName.length property.

Use the .length property to set lastNameLength to the number of characters in lastName.
